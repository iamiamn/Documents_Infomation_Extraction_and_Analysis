IEEE 802.11y this report is to be submitted to the IEEE 802 executive committee to support the request to forward IIEEE 802.11y to sponsor ballot july 2007 doc IEEE 802.11-07/2208r1 submission page peter ecclesine cisco systems introduction and summary this is the report to the IEEE 802 executive committee that documents all the WG letter ballots of IEEE 802.11y including voting results comment statistics and unresolved negative comments the total number of voters on IEEE 802.11y is 347 the final results of the voters on IEEE 802.11y are 326 voted 242 yes 24 no 60 abstained for 90.98 approval rate return percentage of 93.9 and an abstain percentage of 18.4 there are 125 outstanding negative comments from seventeen remaining negative voters forty seven of these outstanding negative comments are from the latest latter ballot and the remaining 68 outstanding negative comments are previously recirculated unresolved negative comments from previous letter ballots based on results of the letter ballots on IEEE 802.11y as documented in this report we are asking for approval from the IEEE 802 executive committee to forward IEEE 802.11y to sponsor ballot agenda items and motions requesting conditional approval to forward when the prior ballot has closed shall be accompanied by date the ballot closed vote tally including approve disapprove and abstain votes comments that support the remaining disapprove votes and working group responses schedule for recirculation ballot and resolution meeting letter ballot 94 was vote on draft 1.0 and ran for 40 days starting 12 december 2007 and ending on january 2007 309 voted 182 yes 59 no 71 abstained 75.52 approval rate approve 182 disapprove comments 59 abstain 71 letter ballot 104 was recirculation vote on draft 2.0

approval rate approve 129 disapprove comments abstain 28 166 ballots cast subsequently two negative voters have changed their votes to approve and at this time there are 17 negative voters with comments recorded in the comment database note that the resolutions for LB 106 comments have not yet been approved by the WG of the total 124 no-voter unsatisfied comments from all letter ballots many are non-technical comments marked technical and many address similar topics the comments may be categorized as follows 62 required comments on draft 1.0 with no subsequent negative voter participation they mainly had an issue related with tgn timelines the channel switch announcment text that also appeared in tgn draft 1.0 LB 84 and tgv and in subsequent events got consolidated into july 2007 doc IEEE 802.11-07/2208r1 submission page peter ecclesine cisco systems tgy as it is scheduled to complete before tgn and tgv at the time of LB 94 the tgn channel switch announcement defined another way to change regulatory classes and proponents of that scheme made comments in LB 94 to remove extended channel switching tgn then changed their definition of what regulatory classes would be required and in tgn draft 2.0 adopted the tgy language for LB 97 if the WG approves the proposed LB 106 comment resolutions there will be just three channel switch announcment comments from LB 104 and 106 that remain rejected LB comment accept accept in principle reject 94 technical required 19 25 23 94 editorial required 104 technical required 104 editorial required 106 technical required 12 24 106 editorial required 37 56 32 there was one required comment on LB 104 “Confusions from submitting redline version without providing rationale to voters.” and suggesting “Cancel and reissue ballot with justification for redline draft and include clean version too.” which the task group considers out of scope if the WG agrees it is out of scope then the voter’s previous approve vote on LB 94 would be the official one not the negative vote on LB 104 the working group responses to all of these unsatisfied comments are on the following pages IEEE 802.11y 3.0 3650-3700 mhz operation in USA comments

stas be mobile or portable within broad registered location how can operation within the rules occur indoors can indoor shielded from outdoor transmissions from enabling STA operation in an entire building be permitted if at least one indoor STA is enabled by the distant registered fixed STA and can relay the information to other indoor stas can DSE enabled STA enable nearby stas which cannot receive the direct transmission from the distant fixed registered STA for instance mobile stas in cars which enter town and are shielded by buildings along the street from the horizon can STA be enabled by being in radio range of STA that can directly receive beacons from fixed registered STA if STA is enabled on chan can it transmit on channel while continuing to monitor for enabling beacons on channel once each minute suggestedremedy please answer these questions and clarify text where needed BTW this is great work in fairly short time period by very dedicated and skilled task group KUDOS your use and explanation of known draft defects and ongoing efforts in editorial notes on page vii should be model for all drafts PROPOSED ACCEPT IN PRINCIPLE the questions should be answered in
